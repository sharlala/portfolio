If you want to create a guest post that will appear as if written by another author, simply add an `author` attribute to the 
YAML header of your blog post. This will be picked up in the template and displayed in the meta-section both on the front page 
as well as on the individual post pages.

<img style="max-width:100%;border:1px solid #ddd;" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img-work-1.png"></img>
