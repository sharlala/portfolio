description: In the spring of 2016, the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business launched a rebranding initiative in an effort to update the school's image and improve diversity awareness. As the point person for this initiative, I oversaw the redesign of all brand elements to develop a creative direction that was both professional and cohesive.
