description: Upon entering Chicago Booth's School of Business, I was given a task that was set aside and needed immediate attention.  Given two days, I was able to create this Social Media Year in Review info-graphic.  Organized by months, I was trying to find a way to bring simplicity to a heavily text based year in review.  By creating icon's for each achievement, it captured the attention of the viewer and helped each one stand out. The color palette was limited to Chicago Booth's colors. Overall, the design was a success and helped my client present his work with great success.
