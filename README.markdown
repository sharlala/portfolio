Here are instructions for updating your portfolio. 

Main Files
------------
You shouldn't need to update the code in any of these files too much; all the things you add for each work (a.k.a. post) should update dynamically. Nonetheless, here is a rundown of where you can find the code for different parts of each page:

- **default.html** (located in [_layouts](https://github.com/peteryskim/portfolio/tree/gh-pages/_layouts) folder) - This file contains the code for the header (where it says "Peter Kim") and footer of all pages. 
- **index.html** - This file contains the the code for the About, Contact, and Selected Works sections of your home page. 
- **post.html** (located in [_layouts](https://github.com/peteryskim/portfolio/tree/gh-pages/_layouts)) folder) - This file contains the code for each individual work page, including the Description, Role, and body. It does not include the header and footer, which can be found in default.html. 

Adding a Work
------------
1. Create a new post in the [_posts](https://github.com/peteryskim/portfolio/tree/gh-pages/_posts) folder. You can do this by creating a new file on your computer in Sublime Text. 
2. Give the post a name that follows the following syntax: *YYYY-MM-DD-work-name.markdown* (Note: the date does not appear anywhere but is simply a way to make sure your works appear in the appropriate order; more recent dates will appear first.) 
3. Copy the contents in one of the existing works and edit according. See below for specific instructions on editing posts.
